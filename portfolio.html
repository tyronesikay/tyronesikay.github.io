      <p>These items are mainly exercises done while undertaking a Free Code Camp course
        and some sample website i created. I will continue adding items in this page
        so please come back and check it out.
      </p>

        <b style="font-size: 1.1em; color:#d50000">Update:</b> Apparently i will not be uploading any
        Free Code Camp exercises at this time. I find the next exercises
        (<i style="color:#f39c12">calculator, clock, tic-tac-toe</i>, etc...) in the course to be unnecessary,
        for sure i will learn alot from them but at this stage in my learning journey, i don't think i needed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        First,  my goal is to become a <i style="color:#f39c12"> junior Front End developer</i>, so creating and
        designing a page is more important than making a tic-tac-toe or a calculator. Second, looking at some of the
        websites of a <i style="color:#f39c12">potential employers</i>, not a single one of them have those features in
        their sites.  Third, when i created this website/portfolio, i struggle with positioning of every elements,
        got confused about the font property not changing when i'm sure that i'm typing the right code and eventually
        i found out it's because of inheritance, knowing how to do all these are the basic skills i need to know to become a
        front end developer,  and doing the remaining exercises won't help me at all to master these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my plan right now is to create alot more website that's responsive,  there won't be any content in them
        so it's like a template. Stay tuned.
