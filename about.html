      <p>Hi, Welcome to my portfolio. I’m a self-taught web developer located in <i style="color: #d35400">Alhambra, <strong>CA.</strong></i>
        I have a Bachelors degree in <i style="color:#d35400">Mechanical Engineering</i>, and used to work as a
        fire sprinkler designer.
      </p>
      <p>
        For sometime now I wanted to change career but the thought of leaving a stable job
        with a decent paycheck scares the hell out of me, especially when I have a
        family of four to support.  But this year I decided to face that fear and
        quit my job of almost 15 years to pursue a career in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve created this page not for the content but to show that i can create a
        website and used the skills i’ve learned, head over to my
        <i><a href="https://github.com/ungas/ungas.github.io" target="blank" style="color:#ff0000 !important" class="fa fa-github"><strong>Github</strong></a></i> account if you
        want to see the code.  This is a work in progress so I will be updating this often.

      </p>
