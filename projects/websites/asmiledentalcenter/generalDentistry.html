						<p>As a general and family dental office, our goal is to keep your teeth and gums healthy for a lifetime. To achieve this goal, we provide thorough cleanings and comprehensive checkups for patients of all ages. Additionally, our friendly team will educate you and your family about proper home-care techniques that will improve your oral health.</p>
						<p>Even if your teeth appear healthy, you still need to see the dentist regularly. We inspect your teeth and gums for early signs of gum disease and oral cancer, potentially life threatening issues that can be treated if caught early. Other concerns that you may be unaware of include bruxism (teeth grinding) and impacted wisdom teeth. Dr. Toquero has extensive training in general dentistry, and will recommend treatments that may reduce the need for reconstructive dentistry in the future.</p>
						<p>An integral part of maintaining your teeth for life is the removal of plaque and tartar on a regular basis. At your hygiene appointment, we will remove tartar buildup from below the gum line and show you proper brushing and flossing techniques. For patients with advanced needs, we may recommend periodontal therapy.</p>

								<h3>Laser Gum Treatment</h3>
								<p>Laser treatment is an advanced technique for your doctor to treat periodontal disease and save teeth that were previously considered hopeless. A laser light is used to gently remove harmful bacteria and diseased tissue from the gum pocket. This allows the body to heal naturally so that the gum pockets improve and the teeth become more stable. The laser is a wonderful tool that will help many patients bring themselves to a more healthy state.</p>

								<h3>TMJ</h3>
								<p>Temporomandibular Joint and Muscle Disorders (TMJD) refers to a complex and poorly understood set of conditions that can cause pain in the area of the jaw joint and associated muscles and/or problems using the jaw. Both or just one of the TM joints may be affected. TMJD can affect a personâ€™s ability to speak, eat, chew, swallow, make facial expressions and even breathe.</p>

								<h3>Root Canal Treatment</h3>
								<p>Root Canal Treatment (RCT) usually entails one to three visits. During the first visit, a small hole is drilled through the top of the tooth and into the inner chamber. Diseased tissue is removed, the inner chamber cleansed and disinfected and the tiny canals reshaped. The cleansed chamber and canals are filled with an elastic material and medication designed to prevent infection. If necessary, the drilled hole is temporarily filled until a permanent seal is made with a crown.</p>

								<h3>Periodontal Treatment (Cleaning)</h3>
								<p>You should have a standard cleaning at least twice a year. A periodontal treatment includes an Adult Prophy (basic cleaning). If it has been over a year since your last cleaning, possible treatment will include either Periodontal Scaling (deep cleaning) or Root Planning and Scaling (requires anesthetic).</p>

								<h3>Athletic and Night Guards</h3>
								<p>Whether you are an athlete or casual sports participant, you should wear a mouth guard to protect your teeth. If you grind your teeth while you sleep, a night guard will help reduce symptoms of TMJ. We custom make mouth guards in both soft and hard materials.</p>

								<h3>Composite Fillings (White Fillings)</h3>
								<p>A composite filling is used to repair a tooth that is affected by decay, cracks, fractures, etc. The filling is also colored to match the tooth giving it a seamless look and feel.</p>
