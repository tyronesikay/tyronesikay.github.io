						<p>A brilliant, youthful smile will make you feel good about your appearance, which can in turn increase your self-esteem. The American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry found that people with a beautiful smile are viewed as friendlier, more successful, and more intelligent than those with a less attractive smile. If you’re ready to enhance your image, cosmetic dentistry is a great place to start.</p>
						<p>Dr. Toquero has focused much of her studies on whole-mouth harmony. She would love the opportunity to help you achieve a straighter, brighter, bolder smile that feels great. You’ve worked hard for a sophisticated, mature image, so we offer clear braces from Invisalign, as well as porcelain veneers, Lumineers, many teeth-whitening systems, and even a full smile makeover.</p>

								<h3>Dental Implants</h3>
								<p>A missing tooth can be replaced with a more permanent solution than a bridge or denture, in the form of a dental implant. Implants involve the implantation of an artificial tooth root in the jaw and the application of a new, natural looking prosthetic tooth onto that root.</p>

								<img class="float-left img-responsive" title="Dental Crowns" src="img/crown.png" alt="Dental Crowns" width="133" height="101" />
								<h3>Dental Crowns</h3>
								<p>A crown (or cap) is a covering that encases the entire tooth surface restoring it to its original shape and size. Although there are several types of crowns, porcelain (tooth colored crown) are the most popular. They are highly durable and will last many years, but like most dental restorations, they may eventually need to be replaced.</p>

								<h3>Porcelain Veneers</h3>
								<p>Porcelain veneers are are custom fitted to your individual teeth and are the best solution for a dental overlay because of the natural properties they contribute. When bonded to your teeth porcelain cosmetic veneers provide a very strong and lasting surface. Since the material used in porcelain veneers is a glass-like ceramic, their translucency is almost identical to your own teeth, giving you a very natural smile.</p>

								<h3>Lumineers</h3>
								<p>Lumineers are contact lens-thin and are placed over existing teeth without having to remove painful tooth structure (unlike traditional veneers.) Lumineers are the painless, permanent cosmetic solution for stained, chipped, discolored or misaligned teeth.</p>

								<h3>Snap-On Smile</h3>
								<p>Snap-on smile offers a simple, life-changing solution for many patients of all ages; those with crooked, stained or missing teeth or with gaps, patients who are not candidates for implants or bridges, people undergoing full-mouth reconstruction or implant procedures, patients who want to avoid shots and drilling, as well as those who simple want better functioning teeth quickly or a preview of what modern dentistry has to offer. Thousands of patients worldwide have already experienced the benefits of Snap-on smile.</p>

								<img class="float-left img-responsive" title="Teeth Whitening" src="img/zoom.png" alt="Teeth Whitening" width="133" height="101" />
								<h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
								<p>The easiest, fastest and most popular smile improvement procedure available comes in the form of teeth whitening. Aesthetic Smile Dental Center uses two procedures for whitening, Zoom! Chair Side Teeth Whitening System or the “Nite White” home bleaching kit.</p>
